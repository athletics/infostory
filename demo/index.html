			<p style="font: normal 18px/24px Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif;">Jock Whitney, one of the last publishers of the late, great New York Herald Tribune, said in the 1960s that news is more than what happens. He was referring to the insights, passion and life brought to events of the day by the Trib's murderer's row of reporters  -- Tom Wolfe, Jimmy Breslin, Gail Sheehy, Judith Christ, Martin Mayer and many others.The Trib took journalism's essential mission to inform to an entirely new level by tapping the skills of its writers to observe, interpret and select, with all their biases. Taken together, the paper created a daily reading experience like no other.</p>

There's much more to do, and we have a product road map that stretches till the end of 2013. For now, here's a look at what we've done so far, with my rollover remarks and observations about each one.</p>
